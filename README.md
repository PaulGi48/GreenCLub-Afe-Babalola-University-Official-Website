At Green Club, we are on a mission to make a positive impact on our environment and promote sustainable practices within our university community. We believe in the power of collective action and education to bring about change.

- **Community Outreach:** Green Club is not just about our university; we reach out to local communities, organizing tree-planting drives, clean-up events, and more to contribute to a cleaner and greener world.
